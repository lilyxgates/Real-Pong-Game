# Real Pong

Play pong! This is my first game! This program was written following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGf2GcyHPhc).

## Installation

1. Open the correct application for your operating system (the next few steps require typing into this application):

    Operating System | Application

    Mac | [Terminal application for Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac)
    Windows | [PowerShell application for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.2)
    Ubuntu | [Terminal application for Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)

1. Make sure that a recent version of Python 3 is installed. You can check by typing the following and pressing Enter in the application you just opened:

    ```
    python3 --version
    ```

    If you don't see output that looks like `Python x.x.x`, you can download Python 3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
